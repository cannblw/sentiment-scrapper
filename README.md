# Sentiment Scrapper

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

Toy project to perform sentiment analysis of New York Time's news using Google Cloud's AI services.

## Technologies used

This software is fully written in the Go programming language (https://golang.org/). To ensure that the scanned news are unique, the URLs are stored in an AWS DynamoDB table. The body of the news are sent to Google Cloud to perform sentiment analysis and the results are displayed in a simple frontend made in React.

All the infrastructure is deployed with Terraform.
